## I. Big Names

### Self-driving cars

#### 1. Apollo - Self-driving Car

[Apollo](http://apollo.auto/) - Apollo is an open source autopilot platform that contains almost everything. Including hardware, systems, vehicle platforms, cloud services, etc. You can quickly build a self-driving system of your own by Apollo.


- Official Documentation <https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/tree/master/docs>.
- Course: Udacity Self-Driving Fundamentals: Featuring Apollo <https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-fundamentals-featuring-apollo--ud0419>.

#### 3. Autoware

[Autoware.AI](https://www.autoware.ai/) - The original Autoware project built on ROS 1. Launched as a research and development platform for autonomous driving technology.

[Autoware.Auto](https://www.autoware.auto/) - Autoware reimagined. Based on ROS 2. Autoware.Auto is managed by an open-source community manager, applies best-in-class software engineering practices, and is based son a redesigned architecture.

#### 4. Openpilot

[Openpilot](https://comma.ai/) - openpilot is an open source, semi-automated driving system developed by comma.ai. This system is an add-on device which can be installed on multiple car models to provide autonomous features.

### Autonomous robots

#### 1. TurtleBot

[TurtleBot](https://www.turtlebot.com/) is a low-cost, personal robot kit with open-source software. TurtleBot was created at Willow Garage by Melonee Wise and Tully Foote in November 2010. With TurtleBot, youâ€™ll be able to build a robot that can drive around your house, see in 3D, and have enough horsepower to create exciting applications. - **[TurtleBot website](https://www.turtlebot.com/)**.

## II. Other Projects

[ADAS on Jetson Nano](https://news.developer.nvidia.com/jetson-project-of-the-month-driver-assistance-system-using-jetson-nano/). This is an ADAS system that uses Jetson Nano as the hardware with four main functions: forward collision warning, lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition and overspeed warning.
