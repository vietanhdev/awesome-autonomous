- [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) - This simulator is built for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree course and only can be used for specific purposes on this course. 
- [Microsoft's AirSim](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim) - An open-source and cross platform simulator built for drones and other vehicles. AirSim is designed as a platform for AI research to experiment with deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous vehicles. 
- [CARLA](http://carla.org/) - CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites, environmental conditions, full control of all static and dynamic actors, maps generation and much more.
- [Lgsvl](https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/) - The LGSVL Simulator is a simulator that facilitates testing and development of autonomous driving software systems. The LGSVL simulator is developed by the Advanced Platform Lab at the LG Electronics America R&D Center, formerly the LG Silicon Valley Lab.
